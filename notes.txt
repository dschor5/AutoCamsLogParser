Notes:

1) Percentage of Correct Diagnosis
   - Was the percentage of the six faults occurring per block for which the first repair 
     order sent was correct, a measure of quality of fault identification performance
   * Not used for this analysis because it would yield very few samples. 
   * Estimate: 5 people * 6 days = 30 samples total. 
   
2) Fault Identification Time
   - Time (in seconds) from appearance of the master alarm until the correct repair
     order was issued. This measure was used to assess speed of fault identification
     performance.
   * FIT = Correct Repair time - Fault time 
   
3) Out of Target Error
   - Was defined as the time (in seconds) the most critical system parameter (oxygen) 
     was out of target range when a system fault was present, a measure of quality of 
     the fault management.   
   * Not used in this analysis. The manual processes were not tested, so it is not meaningful.
   
4) Mean Response Time
   - Time (in milliseconds) to the appearance of the “communication link” icon   
   * 
   
5) Prospective memory performance
   - Proportion of entries of carbon dioxide records that were provided within the 
     correct time interval (i.e., full minute ±5 s)
   * 
   
6) Automation Verification Time
   - Time interval (in seconds) from the appearance of the master warning until
     sending of a first repair order, regardless of whether this order was correct
   * AVT = First Repair Time - Fault Time
   
7) Automation Verification Sampling of Relevant Parameters
   - Proportion of all system parameters accessed that, in principal, were considered 
     useful (relevant) to cross-check the automatically generated diagnosis for a 
     given malfunction
   * 
   
8) Automation Verification Sampling of Necessary Parameters
   proportion of all system parameters accessed immediately necessary to cross-check a
   given diagnosis unambiguously
   
9) Has Automation Failure
   0 = No automation failure
   1 = Automation failure
