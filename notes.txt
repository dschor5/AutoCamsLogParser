Notes:

1) Percentage of Correct Diagnosis
   was the percentage of the six faults occurring per block for which the first repair 
   order sent was correct, a measure of quality of fault identification performance
   
2) Fault Identification Time
   time (in seconds) from appearance of the master alarm until the correct repair
   order was issued. This measure was used to assess speed of fault identification
   performance.
   
3) Out of Target Error
   was defined as the time (in seconds) the most critical system parameter (oxygen) 
   was out of target range when a system fault was present, a measure of quality of 
   the fault management.   
   
4) Mean Response Time
   time (in milliseconds) to the appearance of the “communication link” icon   
   
5) prospective memory performance
   proportion of entries of carbon dioxide records that were provided within the 
   correct time interval (i.e., full minute ±5 s)
   
6) Automation Verification Time
   time interval (in seconds) from the appearance of the master warning until
   sending of a first repair order, regardless of whether this order was correct
   
7) Automation Verification Sampling of Relevant Parameters
   proportion of all system parameters accessed that, in principal, were considered 
   useful (relevant) to cross-check the automatically generated diagnosis for a 
   given malfunction
   
8) Automation Verification Sampling of Necessary Parameters
   proportion of all system parameters accessed immediately necessary to cross-check a
   given diagnosis unambiguously
